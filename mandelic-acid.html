                <h2>Mandelic Acid</h2>
                <p>Mandelic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that is derived from bitter almonds. It is less common than other AHAs, such as glycolic acid and lactic acid, but has been gaining popularity in recent years for its ability to exfoliate and improve skin texture.</p>
                <p>Some benefits of mandelic acid include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Exfoliates the skin</li>
                    <li>- Helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles</li>
                    <li>- Can help improve the appearance of acne-prone skin</li>
                    <li>- Can be gentler on the skin than other AHAs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Mandelic acid can be found in various skincare products such as cleansers, toners, serums, and peels. As with any new skincare product, it's important to follow the instructions and consult with a dermatologist before incorporating it into your routine.</p><br>
