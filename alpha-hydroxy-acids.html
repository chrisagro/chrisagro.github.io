                <h2>Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA)</h2>
                <p>Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are a group of water-soluble acids that are commonly used in skincare products to exfoliate the skin and improve skin texture. The most commonly used AHAs in skincare products are glycolic acid, lactic acid, and mandelic acid.</p>
                <p>Some benefits of alpha hydroxy acids include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Exfoliates the skin</li>
                    <li>- Helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles</li>
                    <li>- Helps to improve the appearance of hyperpigmentation and age spots</li>
                    <li>- Can be gentler on the skin than other exfoliants such as physical scrubs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Alpha hydroxy acids can be found in various skincare products such as cleansers, toners, serums, and peels. As with any new skincare product, it's important to follow the instructions and consult with a dermatologist before incorporating it into your routine.</p><br>
