                <h2>Glycerin</h2>
                <p>Glycerin is a natural humectant that is commonly used in skincare products to help hydrate the skin. It works by drawing water into the skin and preventing moisture loss, leaving the skin feeling soft and supple. Glycerin is also known to help improve the skin barrier function, which can help protect the skin from environmental stressors.</p>
                <p>Some benefits of glycerin include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Hydrates the skin</li>
                    <li>- Improves the skin barrier function</li>
                    <li>- Protects the skin from environmental stressors</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p>Glycerin can be found in various skincare products such as moisturizers, serums, and masks. Always follow the product instructions and consult with a dermatologist before incorporating new skincare products into your routine.</p><br>
