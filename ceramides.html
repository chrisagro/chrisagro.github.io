                <h2>Ceramides</h2>
                <p>Ceramides are lipids that are naturally found in the skin and are important for maintaining a healthy skin barrier. Skincare products that contain ceramides can help improve the skin barrier function and prevent moisture loss, which can lead to dry, irritated skin. Ceramides are also known to help soothe and calm the skin, making them a great ingredient for sensitive skin types.</p>
                <p>Some benefits of ceramides include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Improves the skin barrier function</li>
                    <li>- Prevents moisture loss</li>
                    <li>- Soothes and calms the skin</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p>Ceramides can be found in various skincare products such as moisturizers, cleansers, and serums. Always follow the product instructions and consult with a dermatologist before incorporating new skincare products into your routine.</p><br>
