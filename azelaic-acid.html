                <h2>Azelaic Acid</h2>
                <p>Azelaic acid is a medication used to treat acne. It works by reducing the growth of bacteria that can cause acne, as well as by decreasing the production of keratin, which can clog pores and lead to acne breakouts.
                    Azelaic acid is available in both prescription and over-the-counter forms, and it comes in the form of a cream or gel that is applied directly to the skin. It is typically used once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the acne.
                    When used as directed, azelaic acid can be effective at reducing the number and severity of acne breakouts. It is generally well-tolerated by most people, although some may experience mild skin irritation or dryness at the site of application.</p><br>
