                <h2>Squalane</h2>
                <p>Squalane is a lightweight, non-greasy oil that is derived from squalene, which is naturally found in the skin. Skincare products that contain squalane can help improve the skin's moisture barrier and prevent moisture loss, which can lead to dry, dehydrated skin. Squalane is also known for its anti-inflammatory properties, which can help soothe and calm the skin.</p>
                <p>Some benefits of squalane include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Improves the skin's moisture barrier</li>
                    <li>- Prevents moisture loss</li>
                    <li>- Soothes and calms the skin</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Squalane can be found in various skincare products such as moisturizers, facial oils, and serums. Always follow the product instructions and consult with a dermatologist before incorporating new skincare products into your routine.</p><br>
