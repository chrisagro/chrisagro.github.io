                <h2>Benzoyl Peroxide</h2>
                <p>Benzoyl Peroxide is a popular acne-fighting ingredient that works by killing bacteria that cause acne and helps unclog pores. It is effective in treating mild to moderate acne and can be found in various over-the-counter products, including cleansers, gels, creams, and spot treatments.</p>
                <p>When using Benzoyl Peroxide, it is essential to start with a lower concentration and gradually increase it if needed. This will help minimize potential skin irritation. Also, make sure to use a moisturizer and sunscreen, as Benzoyl Peroxide can cause dryness and increased sensitivity to the sun.</p><br>
