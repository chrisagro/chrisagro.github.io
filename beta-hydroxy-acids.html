                <h2>Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA)</h2>
                <p>Beta hydroxy acid (BHA) is a type of exfoliant that is oil-soluble, which means it can penetrate deep into the pores to unclog them. The most commonly used BHA in skincare products is salicylic acid, which is known for its ability to treat acne and other skin concerns.</p>
                <p>Some benefits of beta hydroxy acids include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Exfoliates the skin</li>
                    <li>- Helps to unclog pores</li>
                    <li>- Helps to reduce the appearance of acne, blackheads, and whiteheads</li>
                    <li>- Can be gentler on the skin than other exfoliants such as physical scrubs</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p>Beta hydroxy acids can be found in various skincare products such as cleansers, toners, spot treatments, and masks. As with any new skincare product, it's important to follow the instructions and consult with a dermatologist before incorporating it into your routine.</p><br>
