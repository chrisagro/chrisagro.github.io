                <h2>Glycolic Acid</h2>
                <p>Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that is commonly used in skincare products to exfoliate and brighten the skin. It works by breaking down the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to be sloughed away more easily. This can help improve the appearance of dull, uneven skin tone and texture.</p>
                <p>Some benefits of glycolic acid include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Exfoliates the skin</li>
                    <li>- Improves the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles</li>
                    <li>- Brightens and evens skin tone</li>
                    <li>- Helps to unclog pores</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Glycolic acid can be found in various skincare products such as cleansers, toners, serums, and peels. Always follow the product instructions and consult with a dermatologist before incorporating new skincare products into your routine.</p><br>
